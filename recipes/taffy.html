        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Waking up on a slow Saturday morning still reminds me of the sweet smells of taffy from Grandma's kitchen.</p>
            <p>It would always make the 16+ hour drive to see them worth it</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The recipe is simple. Here's what you need:</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups Sugar</li>
                <li>2 TBS Cornstarch</li>
                <li>4 TBS Butter</li>
                <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Corn Syrup</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cup Water</li>
                <li>2 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>

                    <p>corn syrup and water; mix well. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to </p> 
                    <p>mix in butter. Heat to 275 degrees F (134 degrees C), or until a small amount of</p>
                    <p>syrup dropped from a spoon forms hard but pliable threads.</p></li>
                    <p></p>
                <li><p>Remove from heat, and stir in the vanilla, flavored extract and food coloring. </p>

                    <p>candy from the pan, and pull until it loses its shine and becomes stiff. Pull </p>
                    <p>Pinto ropes, and use scissors to cut into 1 inch pieces. Wrap each piece in </p>
                    <p>waxed paper.</p></li>
