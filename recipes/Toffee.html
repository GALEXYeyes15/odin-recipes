        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Need an edible gift that'll please everyone on your list? Look no further than toffee!</p> 
        <p>This top-rated toffee recipe is beloved by the Allrecipes community because it's easy,</p>
        <p>quick, and absolutely irresistible.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup finely chopped almonds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine butter, sugar, and salt in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat; stir constantly in one direction until butter is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, line a 9x13-inch baking dish with a sheet of parchment paper, letting it overhang two sides of the dish.</li>
            <li>Once the butter has melted, stop stirring and bring mixture to a boil. Once boiling, cook, stirring only 2 to 3 times, until it turns a dark amber color and the temperature reaches 285 degrees F (137 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Immediately pour toffee into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle chocolate chips on top and let sit until they soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Use a spatula to spread softened chocolate into a thin, even layer. Sprinkle nuts over the chocolate and press down slightly; wearing a plastic bag over your hand will minimize the mess.</li>
            <li>Place toffee in the refrigerator until set, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Lift hardened toffee out of the baking dish with the parchment paper. Break into pieces and store in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
